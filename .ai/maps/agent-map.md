## Tool Adapter Routing

Treat `.agents/roles/` and `.agents/skills/` as canonical. After changing either source, run `scripts/sync-ai-adapters.ps1 -Target all` to refresh generated adapters. `scripts/generate-ai-adapters.ps1` remains a compatibility wrapper.

- Claude adapters in `.claude/`
- Codex agents in `.codex/agents/`
- Cursor rules and skills in `.cursor/`
- GitHub Copilot agents and skills in `.github/`
- OpenCode agents and skills in `.opencode/`
